# nodeprojectsampler
A little python project that generates node projects as I like them (doesn't mean as you should organize them)

## explanation

These last months, I develop a lot of project using Node.js, I often use a project organization not covered correctly (in my opinion) by the miscellanous generators I found on the Internets, and I wanted to code a tool like this anyway. 

So here is my Node-express-ejs-whateveryou'llwant-projects generator. 

As usual, I'm open to suggestions and advices 

Have a nice day .o/
